You survived the first lecture and now it's time to try out some R.

We will use self-guided tutorials for the workshops.
Just read the instructions and test your skills by writing and running code in the dedicated boxes.
If you see three dots `...` in the code box, you have to delete them and write code instead, based on the exercise prompt.

Sometimes there will be multiple-choice questions. Pick the correct answer and hit `Submit Answer` to check it.

When you are ready to move to the next section, just click `Next topic` or `Continue`.

If you get stuck, ask the instructor for help!

Enjoy 🙂

## Mathematical operations

Let's start with some basic mathematical operations.

Run the following code to see the results.

```{r maths, exercise=TRUE}
14 + 75

76.5 - 13.46

5 * 2598

4209 / 3
```

Now is your time to try!

Write the code to calculate the following:

1. Sum 5 with 8 and multiply by 3 (should be `39`).

2. Divide 60 by the sum of 5 and 3 (should be `7.5`).

3. Divide the sum of 76 and 43 multiplied by 5, by the difference between the product of 5 and 3 and the product of 7 and 8 (should be `-14.5122`).

```{r paren, exercise=TRUE}
# 1.
...
# 2.
...
# 3.
...
```

## Variables

### Create a variable

Let's try creating some variables.

Assign the value `4` to a variable called `fruit`.
Then subtract 1 from it.

```{r var, exercise=TRUE}
# Create the variable
...
# Subtract 1 from it
...
```

### More than one value

We can assign more than a value to a variable, as long as they are all of the same type (like numeric or a string).

```{r combine, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "Which of the following functions can be used to assign multiple values to a variable?",
  answer("`cat()`"),
  answer("`print()`"),
  answer("`c()`", correct = TRUE),
  answer("`t()`")
)
```

Now create a variable `houses` with the values `"Gryffindor", "Slytherin", "Hufflepuff"`.

```{r houses, exercise=TRUE}
houses <- ...
```

### Re-use variables

Oops! We forgot one Hogwarts house.
Let's fix that!

```{r extra, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "Which of the following lines of code let us add an extra value to `houses`?",
  answer('`houses <- c(houses, "Ravenclaw")`', correct = TRUE),
  answer('`houses <- c("Ravenclaw")`'),
  answer('`houses + "Ravenclaw"`')
)
```

Now write the code here and run it to add the missing house!

```{r missing, exercise=TRUE}
houses ...
```

## Functions

```{r function, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "Which of the following is true?",
  answer("A function needs at least one argument."),
  answer("Functions are strings."),
  answer("A function can take one value."),
  answer("Functions can take any number of arguments.", correct = TRUE)
)
```

### Like fish in a pond

Run the following code to find out the mean number of fish spotted in the Water of Leith over four days. 🐡🐠🐟

```{r mean, exercise=TRUE}
fish <- c(1, 6, 2, 10)

sum(fish) / length(fish)

mean(fish)
```

```{r length, echo=FALSE}
question(
  "What does the `lenght()` function do?",
  answer("It calculates the sum of the numbers in the variable."),
  answer("It returns the size of the fish."),
  answer("It returns the number of values in a variable.", correct = TRUE)
)
```

### You did it!

Awesome! You finished the first tutorial.

We hope you are looking forward to the next.
