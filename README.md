Welcome to the main site of the course *Statistics and Quantitative
Methods* (Semester 1).

This will be your go-to place throughout the semester. Use the menu
above to navigate to info pages under `Course info`.

This course is an introduction to study design, statistics and
quantitative data analysis as commonly employed in linguistics, using
the R software.

## Course description

The course will cover the basics of **statistics and quantitative data
analysis**, and how to **design studies** that effectively address the
intended research questions. Students will learn the principles of
**data visualisation and statistical modelling** and develop the
practical skills necessary to perform such analyses. The course will
draw examples from different branches of linguistics and will provide
students with hands-on experience in open science practices.

The course will teach you how to carry out statistical inference using
**Null Hypothesis Significance Testing** and how to correctly interpret
p-values and confidence intervals.

## Install R and RStudio

The workshops require you to have R and RStudio installed on your
laptop.

- To install R, go to <http://cloud.r-project.org/> and pick R (4.2.1)
  for your operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- To install RStudio, go to
  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> and
  download RStudio (Desktop) for your operating system.

## Install the R package

An R package is like a plug-in, that you can install to get access to
more functionalities.

We will be using an R package designed for this course, **sqmf**.

To install sqmf you need to run the following code (copy paste these
lines in the `Console` in RStudio and press ENTER):

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stefanocoretta/sqmf")
```

You will see some text flashing and if it ends in `DONE (sqmf)` then
itâ€™s all good!
